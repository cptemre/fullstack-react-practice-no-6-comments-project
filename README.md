# COMMENTS PROJECT

## FULLSTACK REACT PRACTICE PROJECT NO: 6

1. I created this project to practice my skills using Javascript, React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, HTML, CSS.

2. I practiced useState and useEffect hooks.

3. It tries to get the data from the cloud. If it won't be successful it gets the information from the local hobbits.js file. Because there is no password of my cloud account in this repository, it will take the data locally.

4. This page has comments and you can see next or previous one by clicking arrows and it will slide to center.
